# PythonGuard

With this script, it is possible to execute a script each time a specific file is changed. This is being repeated until the script is stopped. It can be stopped by pressing Ctrl-C two times.

It is necessary that sleep_until_modified.py lies in the same directory as this script!
It is important to always specify the full qualified path.

Example: /complete_path/pythonguard.sh /complete_path/script.sh /complete_path/changing_file.txt [parameters_for_script]
